<h4>Material 1</h4>
<p><em>Doug Rossinow, <cite>The Reagan Era: A History of the 1980s</cite>, 2015</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In the 1980s, conservatives succeeded in remaking large parts of American life. They reshaped American politics, working an alchemy that transmuted conservative dogma&mdash;on the wisdom of low income taxes, the special virtue of entrepreneurs, the parasitic character of government, the need for overwhelming military strength, the dependence of social health on proper values, and the nuclear family as the building block of society&mdash;into common sense. Reagan and his followers scored many victories in the U.S. political system during the 1980s. Along the way, they shifted the American political debate onto Reagan's chosen terrain."</p>
  <p>"Conservatives framed public debates in the 1980s, making the era's politics theirs, as liberals had done in the 1930s and 1960s. The influential and powerful members of the country's major institutions were profoundly affected by Reaganism. Political sages arrived at a new consensus that America was 'naturally' a conservative country."</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Material 2</h4>
<p><em>William C. Berman, <cite>America's Right Turn: From Nixon to Clinton</cite>, 1994</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Like other conservative triumphs, Reagan's election proved that politics and ideology matter in determining who gets what and why. But so does the economy. Intense social, cultural, and racial conflicts moved American presidential politics to the populist right after the late sixties, caused by a crisis that liberalism could not resolve or transcend. It was, however, the presence of persistent inflation and the changes wrought at home by the process of globalization that exacerbated those conflicts and elected Ronald Reagan in 1980. Social issues helped Reagan win a landslide victory in 1984, but it was a downturn in the inflation rate and an upturn in the economy that clinched his reelection."</p>
  <p>"When Reagan ran for the White House in 1980, he promised the American people jobs and prosperity via supply-side economics. But eventually the bill for Reaganomics came due, amounting to trillions of dollars in new governmental, corporate, and consumer debt, along with a massive increase in the federal deficit. Reagan's huge spending programs and tax cuts locked the Democrats into playing the politics of austerity. Afraid of the voter's wrath, they could ill afford to be seen as 'tax and spend' Democrats."</p>

<p><em>Russell Hardin, "Civil Liberties in the Era of Mass Terrorism," <cite>Journal of Ethics</cite>, 2004</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Although there has long been terrorism in varied contexts, contemporary terrorism poses a new and ominous problem. We have long considered how to protect citizens against invading armies, and this might be the arena that is most nearly analogous to protection against terrorists. But foreign terrorists are not so transparent as invading armies, and the issue of protecting ourselves against them necessarily involves judgments on how to distinguish them from peaceful citizens and alien residents. For terrorists, who must in the nature of their purpose be secretive, we may be able to discover them before they act only if we resort to invasive and substantial surveillance, infiltration, screening, and so forth, all of which might be misused against innocents far more often than they are well used against potential terrorists."</p>

const immigrationCommissionExcerpt = `
<p><em>United States Commission on Immigration Reform, "U.S. Immigration Policy: Restoring Credibility," report to Congress, 1994</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The Commission believes that legal immigration has strengthened and can continue to strengthen this country. While we will be reporting at a later date on the impacts of our legal immigration system, and while there may even be disagreements among us as to the total number of immigrants that can be absorbed into the United States, the Commission members agree that immigration presents many opportunities for this nation. Immigrants can contribute to the building of the country. The tradition of welcoming newcomers has become an important element of how we define ourselves as a nation."</p>
  <p>"The Commission is mindful of the problems that also emanate from immigration. In particular, we believe that unlawful immigration is unacceptable. Enforcement efforts have not been effective in deterring unlawful immigration."</p>
  <p>"During the decade from 1980 to 1990 three major pieces of legislation were adopted to govern immigration policy. The Commission supports the broad framework for immigration policy that these laws represent: a legal immigration system that strives to serve the national interest in helping families to reunify and employers to obtain skills not available in the U.S. labor force; a refugee system that reflects both our humanitarian beliefs and international refugee law; and an enforcement system that seeks to deter unlawful immigration through employer sanctions and tighter border control."</p>

const kaufmanExcerpt = `
<p><em>Joyce P. Kaufman, <cite>A Concise History of U.S. Foreign Policy</cite>, 2006</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"By the end of the Clinton administration it was clear that U.S. foreign policy had no overarching framework as it did during the Cold War. Rather, each of the two immediate post-Cold War presidents, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, was unsure how to address the emergence of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the humanitarian and human rights crises that accompany them. The result was the emergence of policies that were inconsistent and often opaque."</p>
  <p>"From the start of the Cold War, American presidents based U.S. foreign policy on fighting that war with the hope of 'winning.' The Cold War provided a framework and clear guidelines for foreign and military policy. In the post-Cold War period, U.S. foreign policy has been guided largely by the need to respond to the most pressing crisis or conflict."</p>
