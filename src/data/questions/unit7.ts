<p><em>Henry Louis Gates Jr., historian, "How Was Black Support Enlisted for World War II, When the Armed Services Were Segregated?", 2017</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Since the 1890s, despite the abolition of slavery and the three Reconstruction amendments to the Constitution, Jim Crow segregation pervaded every aspect of American society. The military was no exception. Following the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, black men who volunteered for duty or were drafted were relegated to segregated divisions and combat support roles, such as cook, quartermaster, and grave digger. The military was as segregated as the Deep South."</p>
  <p>"It was difficult for African Americans not to see the hypocrisy between conditions at home and the noble war aims that President Franklin Roosevelt articulated in his famous 'Four Freedoms' speech on January 6, 1941. And because of the gap between the promise and the performance of American freedom when it came to race relations, many black people frankly felt alienated from the war effort."</p>
  <p>"Despite this discrimination, more than 2.5 million African Americans registered for the draft when World War II began; 1 million served. A key voice in the war effort was the Pittsburgh Courier, the nation's most widely read African American newspaper. Two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Courier launched a national campaign that urged black people to give their all for the war effort, while at the same time calling on the government to do all it could to make the rhetoric of the Declaration of Independence and the equal rights amendments to the Constitution real for every citizen, regardless of race. In honor of the battle against enemies from without and within, they called it the Double V campaign."</p>

<p><em>Senator Robert La Follette, speech in the United States Senate, 1917</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Who has registered the knowledge or approval of the American people of the course this Congress is called upon in declaring war upon Germany? Submit the question to the people, you who support it. You who support it dare not do it, for you know that by a vote of more than ten to one the American people as a body would register their declaration against it."</p>
  <p>"I venture to say that the response which the German people have made to the demands of this war shows that it has a degree of popular support which the war upon which we are entering has not and never will have among our people. The espionage bills, the conscription bills, and other forcible military measures... [are] proof that those responsible for this war fear that it has no popular support."</p>
  <p>"It was our absolute right as a neutral power to ship food to the people of Germany... The only reason why we have not suffered the sacrifice of just as many ships and just as many lives from the violation of our rights by the war zone and the submarine mines of Great Britain as we have through the unlawful acts of Germany... is simply because we have submitted to Great Britain's dictation... We have helped to drive Germany into a corner, her back to the wall, to fight with what weapons she can lay her hands on to prevent the starving of her women and children, her old men and babes."</p>

<p><em>Levi C. Hubert, African American journalist, essay reflecting on Harlem in the 1920s, written in 1938</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A few years ago, in the late 1920s, Alain Leroy Locke, a professor at Howard University... came to Harlem to gather material for the now famous Harlem Number of the <cite>Survey Graphic</cite> and was hailed as the discoverer of artistic Harlem."</p>
  <p>"The Whites who read that issue of the <cite>Survey Graphic</cite> became aware that in Harlem, the largest Negro city in the world, there existed a group interested in the fine arts, creative literature, and classical music. So, well-meaning, vapid Whites from downtown New York came by bus, subway, or in limousines, to see for themselves these Negroes who wrote poetry and fiction and painted pictures."</p>
  <p>"Of course, said these pilgrims, it couldn't approach the creative results of Whites, but as a novelty, well, it didn't need standards. The very fact that these Blacks had the temerity to produce so-called Art, and not its quality, made the whole fantastic movement so alluring..."</p>
  <p>"News that Harlem had become a paradise spread rapidly and from villages and towns all over America... there began a [Black] migration of quaint characters, each with a message, who descended upon Harlem, sought out the cafes, lifted teacups with a jutting little finger, and dreamed of sponsors."</p>

<p><em>William Jennings Bryan, acceptance speech for the Democratic presidential nomination, 1900</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability."</p>
  <p>"The Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement, not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government."</p>
  <p>"The Democratic party does not oppose expansion when expansion enlarges the area of the Republic and incorporates land which can be settled by American citizens, or adds to our population people who are willing to become citizens and are capable of discharging their duties as such."</p>

We did not enlist to fight these insurgents, and as few of the men are in favor of holding the islands, we do not feel it our duty to enlist for an additional six months."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I believe, we shall find arguments in favor of the retention of the Philippines as possessions of great value and a source of great profit to the people of the United States which cannot be overthrown. First, as to the islands themselves. They are over a hundred thousand square miles in extent, and are of the greatest richness and fertility."</p>
  <p>"A much more important point is to be found in the markets which they furnish... There can be no doubt that the islands in our peaceful possession would take from us a very large proportion of their imports... With the development of the islands and the increase of commerce and of business activity the consumption of foreign imports would rapidly advance, and of this increase we should reap the chief benefit."</p>
  <p>"Manila, with its magnificent bay, is the prize and the pearl of the East... It will enable American enterprise and intelligence to take a master share in all the trade of the Orient! We have been told that arguments like these are sordid. Sordid indeed!... A policy which proposes to open wider markets to the people of the United States... seems to me a great and noble policy."</p>

  <p>"This most precious and sublime feature of the Yosemite National Park... is in danger of being dammed and made into a reservoir to help supply San Francisco with water and light... thus flooding it from wall to wall and burying its gardens and groves one or two hundred feet deep."</p>
  <p>"That anyone would try to destroy it seems incredible; but sad experience shows that there are people good enough and bad enough for anything. The proponents of the dam scheme bring forward a lot of bad arguments to prove that the only righteous thing to do with the people's parks is to destroy them bit by bit as they are able."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Let me insist again... upon the fact that our duty is twofold, and that we must raise others while we are benefiting ourselves. In bringing order to the Philippines, our soldiers added a new page to the honor-roll of American history, and they incalculably benefited the islanders themselves... Every encouragement should be given to their commercial development, to the introduction of American industries and products."</p>
  <p>"We shall make mistakes; and if we let these mistakes frighten us from our work we shall show ourselves weaklings... We committed plenty of blunders... in our dealings with the Indians. But who does not admit at the present day that we were right in wresting from barbarism and adding to civilization the territory out of which we have made these beautiful United States?"</p>
  <p>"We gird ourselves as a nation, with the stern purpose to play our part manfully in winning the ultimate triumph; and with unfaltering steps tread the rough road of endeavor."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The Communists are in China to stay. And China's destiny is not [Chinese nationalist leader Jiang Jieshi's] but theirs. In this unhappy dilemma, the United States should attempt to prevent the disaster of a civil war through adjustment of the new alignment of power in China by peaceful process."</p>
  <p>"The desirable means to this end is to encourage the reform and revitalization of the Kuomintang so that it may survive as a significant force in a coalition government... If this fails, we must limit our involvement with the Kuomintang and must commence some cooperation with the Communists... in an effort to influence them further into an independent position friendly to the United States."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"In adopting some form of prohibition legislation during World War I, the United States was far from unique. Partial liquor control measures had been enacted by many countries during the war, and some of the new drink regulations lasted permanently."</p>
  <p>"But in its effort to totally eradicate the use of intoxicating liquor, the United States stood alone among major industrialized nations. The moral fervor of evangelical Protestants had intersected with the Progressive reform wave and the institutional openings provided by the war."</p>
  <p>"Combined with political representation weighted heavily to rural districts and the limited political power of the law's targets, the antiliquor crusaders were able to rewrite the Constitution and federal law."</p>
